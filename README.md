# FS25-METools-for-Giants-Editor

This is a Collection of Tools (Scripts) for Giants Editor I wrote over time. There are scripts useful for mapping but also Scripts useful for vehicle integration.
Here we have the FS25 / GE10 Edition, some things have changed, some things have been lost or are no longer needed.
I am working on updating all the older Scripts for the new Environment, also working on adding UI to all my Scripts. 
If you are missing something here, go check out the FS22 Version https://github.com/modelleicher/FS22-METools-for-Giants-Editor-GE9-FS22-

The Collection will be updated and added onto over time, also Scripts might be changed or improved upon. If you are looking for an older Version of a particular Script you can use the Commits to find an older one.
Initial Release on Github for FS25 Version is 24.11.2024.

Bugreports and Feedback is welcome in the Issues :)


There are no Tutorials on the Scripts as of right now but I made sure to add a short explanation into the UI of each Script.
